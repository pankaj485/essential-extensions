list of custom extension packs 

## Why? 
I'm tired of syncing my extensions from one device to another, from one account to another, from one stack to another. So I created custom extension packs which I can group based on the usage which I can install from single place with just a click. I don't have to rely on other sources. Hopefully this will work this time. 

## How to use? 
1. Download the repository
2. Open VsCode 
3. Open command pallate and type `Install from VSIX`
4. Import respective extension 
5. Enjoy
