# essential-extensions
List of extension packs for VsCode.  


## Why This Project?
I've been using different tech stacks, devices and accounts to work on different projects. It's not so easy to configure extensions for relevant accounts, stacks, and devices. To solve the issue, I created the proejct. It includes bunch of extension packs which will incude respective extensions. Once imported, it wil automatically downlod the listed extensions. With a single command, all the extensions can be removed and disabled which somehow resolves the problem. I can easily import and get it easily done for multiple devices easily. 


## How to use? 
1. Clone the repository
2. Open VsCode 
3. Open command pallate and type `Install from VSIX`
4. Select extension of your choice 
5. Enjoy
